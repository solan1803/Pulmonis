Pulmonis is an iOS application designed for asthma patients to encourage a more
optimal asthma care regime.  The system strives to provide a service that allows
patients to self-manage their asthma status effectively and minimise the risk of fa-
tal asthma attacks.  For asthma, the care is patient-driven, with periodical clinical
oversight.  Hence, to best help the asthma community, Pulmonis aims to target the
modalities associated with self-management.

While other existing asthma management applications already provide a platform
for patients to log their asthma symptoms and medication usage, Pulmonis extends
this idea further, acting as a ‘virtual companion’ of the patient by:

•  Analysing daily user inputted data through the use of a Bluetooth integrated
spirometer, to monitor the asthma status of the patient;
•  Recognising when and how to react to deteriorations in asthma condition, fol-
lowing the PAAP framework backed by the NHS and Asthma UK (3);
•  Aiding the patient in avoiding and alleviating potential triggers that exacerbate
their asthma condition.

While acknowledging that applications such as Pulmonis present an effective medium
for informing and instructing asthma sufferers on how to manage their asthma con-
dition, it is not meant as a replacement for the interaction with a health care profes-
sional.  Pulmonis is rather intended as a tool, designed to complement the current
asthma care provided by the NHS.

The NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Harefield & Brompton Hospital, proposed the idea
that would harness the effectiveness of the personalised asthma action plan (PAAP),
and project it onto a more accessible, practical platform for asthma patients.  Such
an idea would work towards alleviating the unnecessary social and economic burden
of asthma on the NHS in the UK.
